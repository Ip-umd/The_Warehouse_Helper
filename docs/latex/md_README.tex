\subsection*{Project Overview}

We have developed a Warehouse Helper robot for Acme Robotics. The Turtlebot3, which we have used as a base robot, uses a path-\/planning algorithm(\+A$\ast$ algorithm) to navigate in a predefined map of warehouse. It then creates an optimal path from start station to goal station, while avoiding obstacles.

We also have implemented the funtionality that robot can navigate to intermediate stations between start station and goal location.

\#\# Package installation 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 $ mkdir -p ~/catkin\_ws/src
2 $ cd ~/catkin\_ws/
3 $ catkin\_make
4 $ source devel/setup.bash
5 $ cd src/
6 $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/Ip-umd/The\_Warehouse\_Helper.git
7 $ cd ..
8 $ catkin\_make
\end{DoxyCode}
 \subsection*{Instructions to run the program (D\+E\+MO)}

To run the program first open a new terminal window and run following commands. 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 $ rosclean purge
2 $ cd <path to catkin\_ws>
3 $ source devel/setup.bash
4 $ roslaunch The\_Warehouse\_Helper warehouseHelperTest.launch
\end{DoxyCode}
 $>$\mbox{[}N\+O\+TE\+: {\bfseries Make sure to run the source devel/setup.\+bash command evertime you want to run the package} otherwise the launch file won\textquotesingle{}t detect the package. Also you will see {\bfseries warnings} which our package will output, on the screen till gazebo is launched completely\mbox{]}

\subsection*{Instructions to run R\+OS Unit-\/\+Tests}

The tests are written using gtest and rostest. Close all the running processes before executing the commands below to run the rostest.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item main.\+cpp
\item A\+Star\+Test.\+cpp
\item Node\+Param\+Test\+Test.\+cpp
\item \hyperlink{_obstacle_map_test_8cpp}{Obstacle\+Map\+Test.\+cpp}
\item warehouse\+Helper\+Test.\+launch
\end{DoxyItemize}

To run the tests, follow these commands\+: In a new terminal, 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 roslaunch The\_Warehouse\_Helper warehouseHelperTest.launch
\end{DoxyCode}
 This command, will build a executable for tests named publish\+Test, which can be run using rosrun command.

In another terminal\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 rosrun The\_Warehouse\_Helper warehouseHelper
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Doxygen Documentation}

Although the repository contains the documentation, if you\textquotesingle{}d still like to generate it then follow the instructions below.

Install doxygen using below commands 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 sudo apt-get install doxygen
2 sudo apt-get install doxygen-gui
\end{DoxyCode}
 After installation run following command to open the doxywizard wherein you can fill in the details as required and set the source code folder to the repository as well. Create a new folder in the repository and select that as the destination directory. Add paths to include and src folders and then proceed with the default settings and generate the documentation. 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 doxywizard
\end{DoxyCode}
